# Privacy Policy

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information:
- **Usage Data**: We collect anonymous data related to the Browser's usage, including device information, browsing history, and accessed websites.
- **Crash Reports**: We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect and analyze crash logs from the application to improve its performance.
- **Google Analytics Data**: We collect data on how the application is used (e.g., features accessed, time spent) to better understand user behavior.
- **Advertising Identifier**: We collect your device's unique advertising identifier (such as Google Advertising ID or Apple's Identifier for Advertisers) for the purpose of serving personalized advertisements and analyzing ad campaign effectiveness.

## 2. How We Use the Information

The information we collect is used for the following purposes:
- To provide and maintain the Browser.
- To improve the user experience and application performance.
- To send necessary updates and notifications.
- To analyze the usage and crash data to enhance stability and functionality.
- To personalize the advertisements you see within the application using the Advertising Identifier and data collected via Google Analytics and Google Ads services.
- To measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and promotional activities.
- To analyze application usage trends via Google Analytics.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may disclose data in the following situations:
- To comply with legal obligations or governmental requests.
- To share anonymized data with third-party service providers (such as Firebase) for optimizing application services.
- To share data, including the Advertising Identifier, with Google for the purpose of running Google Analytics and Google Ads services, which may include interest-based advertising. These third parties are bound by their own privacy policies (e.g., Google's Privacy Policy).

## 4. Firebase Crash Reporting and Google Services

To improve the application's stability, we use Firebase Crashlytics. Firebase collects device information and application state during crashes. This information is not personally identifiable and is solely used for fixing issues.

We also use Google Analytics to collect usage data and Google Ads to display advertisements. These services may use your Advertising Identifier to serve you personalized ads. This helps us to provide the Browser application to you for free.

## 5. Data Protection

We take appropriate security measures to protect your usage data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please be aware that no internet-based transmission can guarantee 100% security.

## 6. Your Choices

The Browser does not collect personally identifiable information, so you do not need to worry about the collection or sharing of such data.

For personalized advertising, you can opt-out by adjusting your device's settings (e.g., "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" on Android). If you opt out, you will still see ads, but they may not be as relevant to you. You may also be able to opt-out of some third-party vendors' use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out Page.

## 7. Changes to the Policy

We may update this privacy policy at any time. The updated policy will be posted within the application. Please review this privacy policy periodically.
