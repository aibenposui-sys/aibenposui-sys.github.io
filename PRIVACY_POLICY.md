# Privacy Policy

## 1. Information We Collect (Via Third-Party Services)

We rely on third-party service providers to collect the following types of information:
- **Usage Data**: Third-party services collect anonymous data related to the Browser's usage, specifically **general device information** (e.g., operating system version, device model) and interactions with application features. **This data does not include your local browsing history or specific accessed websites.**
- **Crash Reports**: We utilize Firebase Crashlytics to collect and analyze crash logs from the application to improve its performance.
- **Google Analytics Data**: Google Analytics collects data on how the application's internal features are used (e.g., features accessed, time spent) to better understand user behavior.
- **Advertising Identifier**: Third-party services collect your device's unique advertising identifier (specifically Apple's Identifier for Advertisers or IDFA) for the purpose of serving personalized advertisements and analyzing ad campaign effectiveness.

## 2. How We Use the Information

The information collected by our third-party services is used for the following purposes:
- To provide and maintain the Browser.
- To improve the user experience and application performance.
- To send necessary updates and notifications.
- To analyze the usage and crash data to enhance stability and functionality.
- To personalize the advertisements you see within the application using the Advertising Identifier and data collected via Google Analytics and Google Ads services.
- To measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and promotional activities.
- To analyze application usage trends via Google Analytics.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may disclose data in the following situations:
- To comply with legal obligations or governmental requests.
- To share anonymized data with third-party service providers (such as Firebase, Google Analytics, and Google Ads) for optimizing application services and delivering ads. These third parties are bound by their own privacy policies (e.g., Google's Privacy Policy).

## 4. Third-Party Services: Firebase and Google Services

To improve the application's stability, we use Firebase Crashlytics. Firebase collects device information and application state during crashes. This information is not personally identifiable and is solely used for fixing issues.

We use Google Analytics to collect usage data and Google Ads to display advertisements. These services may use your Advertising Identifier (IDFA) to serve you personalized ads. **Please note that all data collection is performed by these third-party services, and your local browsing data remains private and is not collected.**

## 5. Data Protection

We take appropriate security measures to protect your usage data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please be aware that no internet-based transmission can guarantee 100% security.

## 6. Your Choices (iOS)

The Browser does not directly collect personally identifiable information.

For personalized advertising, you can control the use of your Advertising Identifier by adjusting your device's settings. **On iOS devices, you can opt-out by enabling the "Limit Ad Tracking" (LAT) feature in your privacy settings.** If you enable this feature, you will still see ads, but they may not be as relevant to you. You may also be able to opt-out of some third-party vendors' use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out Page.

## 7. Changes to the Policy

We may update this privacy policy at any time. The updated policy will be posted within the application. Please review this privacy policy periodically.
